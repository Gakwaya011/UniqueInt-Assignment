# UniqueInt-Assignment

## Overview

This project is a part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course for Enterprise Web Development students. The assignment involves reading a list of integers from an input file, extracting unique integers, and writing them to an output file in sorted order. The implementation must avoid using standard built-in libraries for sorting and list manipulation, promoting a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithm design.
